How to run the code:

1. Navigate to the folder "HW1" in my repository.
2. Open a command line.
3. Run the file named "run.sh" (by typing sh run.sh), which will run the MySQL docker container and the jupyter notebook. 
4. Open the Jupyter notebook via the link http://127.0.0.1:8888/tree?token=... in the command line and open the file titled EDA.ipynb.
5. Open the EDA.ipynb file.
6. Run every cell in the EDA.ipynb file, in order.

Note: you may have to remove existing docker containers if they exist.


I explained my process and justifications in the EDA.ipynb file.


I noticed the syllabus said to specify pseudocode for my algorithms, but because this was just EDA,
I did not use any complicated algorithms.
